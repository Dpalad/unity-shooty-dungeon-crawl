# unity-shooty-dungeon-crawl

This is really just a hobby project for me, while I'm trying to learn how to use Unity 2D to make a game. Will probably use unity models, triangles, squares, etc. or just my own pixel art (essentially the same shapes).

This is an amateur work, so it won't be really good probably. I'll try to keep updating it and to keep coming up with new ideas but no promises.

If anyone sees that, nice! And thank you for reading!
